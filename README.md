# Run Length Encoding with Images
## Overview
**Here is the sample Output:** [SampleOUTPUT_RLE.txt](https://github.com/Neil-Patel-12/Run_Length_Encoding_with_Images/files/12471475/SampleOUTPUT_RLE.txt) <br>
- develop routines to encode and decode data for images using run-length encoding (RLE) <br>
- implement encoding and decoding of raw data, conversion between data and strings, and display of information by creating procedures that can be called from within the program and externally <br>
-	Gained more practice with loops, strings, Python lists, methods, and type-casting. <br>

## What is Run-Length_Encoding
RLE is a form of lossless compression used in many industry applications, including imaging. It is intended to take advantage of datasets where elements (such as bytes or characters) are repeated several times in a row in certain types of data (such as pixel art in games). Black pixels often appear in long “runs” in some animation frames; instead of representing each black pixel individually, the color is recorded once, followed by the number of instances. <br>
